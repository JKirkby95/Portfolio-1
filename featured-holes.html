            <h3>Hole 1</h3>
            <p>
                The first hole at Clare Golf Club is an exciting and challenging start to your round. As a par 4, it
                demands both accuracy and distance control to navigate its 406-yard length. The hole presents golfers
                with a wide-open fairway, inviting an aggressive tee shot to gain an advantage.

            <h3>Hole 3</h3>
            <p>
                The third hole at Clare Golf Club is a formidable par 4, stretching 450 yards. With bunkers lining the
                entire right side, it demands accuracy off the tee. Golfers must carefully navigate their shots to avoid
                the hazards and position themselves for a challenging approach to the green.

            <h3>Hole 5</h3>
            <p>
                The fifth hole at Clare Golf Club offers a picturesque par 5 experience. With trees flanking both sides
                of the fairway, precision off the tee is crucial. The slightly uphill approach to the green adds an
                extra layer of challenge, testing golfers' skill and strategy on this scenic and rewarding hole.

            <h3>Hole 7</h3>
            <p>
                The seventh hole at Clare Golf Club introduces the first par 3 on the course, creating a thrilling
                challenge. Spanning 175 yards, golfers face a daunting shot with the stunning ocean serving as a scenic
                but treacherous backdrop to the left.

            <h3>Hole 10</h3>
            <p>
                The 10th hole at Clare Golf Club is a tantalizing par 4, measuring just 325 yards. While it may seem
                tempting to drive the green in one shot, golfers must exercise caution. The green is well-guarded by
                bunkers, demanding accuracy and strategic shot placement for a successful approach and a chance at
                birdie.

            <h3>Hole 11</h3>
            <p>
                The 11th hole at Clare Golf Club presents golfers with the toughest par 3 on the course. Playing at 189
                yards, it offers an incredibly narrow window for a successful tee shot. The demanding precision required
                to navigate this challenging hole makes it a formidable test of skill and nerves for any golfer.

            <h3>Hole 12</h3>
            <p>
                The 12th hole at Clare Golf Club is a unique par 4, measuring exactly 400 yards. What sets this hole
                apart is its irregular fairway, making it nearly impossible to find an even lie. This challenging
                terrain adds an extra layer of difficulty to approach shots, requiring golfers to adapt their strategy.

            <h3>Hole 17</h3>
            <p>
                The 17th hole at Clare Golf Club presents a golden opportunity for a game-changing eagle on this par 5,
                stretching 461 yards. However, golfers must exercise caution not to succumb to greed. The bunkers lining
                the right side and the surrounding trees pose a constant threat, punishing aggressive shots that stray
                too far off course.
