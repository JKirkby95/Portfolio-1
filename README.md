![am i responsive photo](./assets/images/amiresponsive.png)

Welcome to Clare Golf Club, a premier golfing destination located in county Clare in the west of Ireland. Surrounded by natural beauty, our club offers an exceptional 18-hole course that combines the best of tree-lined and links-style holes. Whether you're a seasoned golfer or a newcomer to the sport, Clare Golf Club promises a memorable golfing experience for players of all levels.

The purpose of this website is to allow anyone to get a preview of the course and book a round for upto 4 players. The main goal for a website like this would be to entice a new customer or a one time customer like a tourist to come play our course. There is an abundance of golf courses in the west of Ireland a website like this would help Clare Golf Club stand out from the crowd.

## User Experience

### Project Goals

- Firstly, it should be obvious that this is a golf club when you click onto the site.

- Use plenty of images to show off our course and to entice new players to play here.

- It should be easy to book a tee time so I placed multiple links to do so on the home page.

- Provide contact information and other useful tools to answer any questions the customer would have e.g the weather on a certain day.

- Provide a brief description of featured holes to give the player an idea of how the course plays.

### Color Scheme

![website color scheme](./assets/images/color_scheme.png)

The colors used in this website are mainly a darker shade of green (#076652) and white. I also used some gold (#FFD700) to highlight the headings on a darker background in the gallery section. A shade of beige was used on the call to action section to make it stand out but i didn't want it to be distracting. I took inspiration from the masters green jacket for my color scheme.

### Typography

The main font used on my site is Raleway, with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case Raleway is not being imported correctly. For my logo I used the Dancing Script font to add some style to it. I used Google fonts to import these styles.

### Wireframes

For my wireframes I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), my wireframes didn't end up exactly like the final project but it gave me a great idea of how it would look.

![hero image](./assets/images/hero.png)

The hero image is probably the first thing a customer would notice when visiting our site, so I wanted to use a great shot of the course and include a call to action. As the main purpose of the page is to attract players.

- Welcome section

![welcome section](./assets/images/welcome_section.png)

- The welcome section seemed to be a big part of a lot of golf club sites i saw while doing my research.

- Similar to mine they mostly contain a few photos of the course and a call to action.

- The welcome section that I took the most inspiration from was the [Trump international at Doonbeg website](https://www.trumpgolfireland.com/)
