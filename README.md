The purpose of this website is to allow anyone to get a preview of the course and book a round for upto 4 players. The main goal for a website like this would be to entice a new customer or a one time customer like a tourist to come play our course. There is an abundance of golf courses in the west of Ireland a website like this would help Clare Golf Club stand out from the crowd.
