![am i responsive photo](./assets/images/amiresponsive.png)

Welcome to Clare Golf Club, a premier golfing destination located in county Clare in the west of Ireland. Surrounded by natural beauty, our club offers an exceptional 18-hole course that combines the best of tree-lined and links-style holes. Whether you're a seasoned golfer or a newcomer to the sport, Clare Golf Club promises a memorable golfing experience for players of all levels.

The purpose of this website is to allow anyone to get a preview of the course and book a round for upto 4 players. The main goal for a website like this would be to entice a new customer or a one time customer like a tourist to come play our course. There is an abundance of golf courses in the west of Ireland a website like this would help Clare Golf Club stand out from the crowd.

### Project Goals

- Firstly, it should be obvious that this is a golf club when you click onto the site.

- Use plenty of images to show off our course and to entice new players to play here.

- It should be easy to book a tee time so I placed multiple links to do so on the home page.

- Provide contact information and other useful tools to answer any questions the customer would have e.g the weather on a certain day.

- Provide a brief description of featured holes to give the player an idea of how the course plays.

### User Stories

### Color Scheme

![website color scheme](./assets/images/color_scheme.png)

The colors used in this website are mainly a darker shade of green (#076652) and white. I also used some gold (#FFD700) to highlight the headings on a darker background in the gallery section. A shade of beige was used on the call to action section to make it stand out but i didn't want it to be distracting. I took inspiration from the masters green jacket for my color scheme.

### Typography

The main font used on my site is Raleway, with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case Raleway is not being imported correctly. For my logo I used the Dancing Script font to add some style to it. I used Google fonts to import these styles.

### Wireframes

For my wireframes I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), my wireframes didn't end up exactly like the final project but it gave me a great idea of how it would look.

![hero image](./assets/images/hero.png)

The hero image is probably the first thing a customer would notice when visiting our site, so I wanted to use a great shot of the course and include a call to action. As the main purpose of the page is to attract players.

- Welcome section

![welcome section](./assets/images/welcome_section.png)

- The welcome section seemed to be a big part of a lot of golf club sites i saw while doing my research.

- Similar to mine they mostly contain a few photos of the course and a call to action.

- The welcome section that I took the most inspiration from was the [Trump international at Doonbeg website](https://www.trumpgolfireland.com/)

## Testing

### Testing User Stories

- As a customer, I want to be able to navigate the website easily.

The nav bar is very simple on this site to help with this it has only 3 options, and enhanced and underlined text to show the user what page they are on currently.

![header](./assets/images/header.png)

- As a customer, I want to be able to learn about the course before I book a time.

This is done in multiple ways, firstly is through the flyover video on our youtube channel linked on the Home page.

Secondly this is done through the Gallery page where you get details about some of our featured holes.

![Flyover Video](./assets/images/flyover.png)

- As a customer, I want to be able to book a tee time directly from the site.

The main goal of the website is to attract players so making it easy to book a time is essential, we did this by having 3 different links to book now on the Home page alone.

![home page book now](./assets/images/home_booking.webp)

- As a customer, I want to be able to find contact information for the business.

This is done mostly through the footer of the page and we have 1 other link to our email on the Home page.

![Email link on home page](./assets/images/learn_more.png)

- As a customer, I want to find social media links to the business.

This is also done through the footer of the website, so it's on every page.

- As a customer, I want to easily find the business' location.

The location can be found in two places, firstly in the footer again so it's on each page.

Secondly it's on the book now page below the form, this time in the form of a Google map.

### Code Validation

- When running my code through the I did find a few errors.

W3C Markup Validator found an error concerning my Iframe I used, it had inline styling included so all I had to do was move the same styling to the css.style sheet.

W3C Markup Validator also found an error where I had misspelled "class" as "classs" in one occasion.

- Thankfully I found no errors in the CSS validator.
