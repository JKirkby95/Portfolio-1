            <p>
                The 7th hole at Clare Golf Course is a challenging par 3 that measures 200 yards in length.
                What sets this hole apart from others is its proximity to the ocean, which can wreak havoc on shots that
                are over-hit.
                The green is situated right by the ocean, which means that any shots that go too far risk being swept
                away by the wind and waves.
                Players need to exercise caution and precision when taking their shots to avoid going over the green.
                The breathtaking views of the ocean make this hole a favorite among golfers, but it also demands a great
                deal of skill and strategy to successfully navigate its unique challenges.

            <p>
                The 12th hole at any golf course can be a challenging and intimidating par 4, and the 12th hole at this
                course is no exception. At 450 yards, this hole is a true test of skill, and with a narrow fairway
                flanked by dense forest on both sides, keeping the ball in play can be a real challenge. The key to
                success on this hole is accuracy and precision, especially on the tee shot. Players must be careful to
                keep their shots straight and avoid hitting into the woods, as recovering from a bad lie can be
                difficult. The fairway is relatively flat, but the green is elevated, which adds another layer of
                difficulty to this already challenging hole. Overall, the 12th hole is a true test of a golfer's skill
                and strategy, and one that can be both rewarding and frustrating depending on how well you play.

            <p>
                The 17th hole at Clare Golf Course is a challenging par 5 that stretches to 525 yards. While the
                fairways
                are relatively wide, players need to be careful with their tee shots as there are plenty of bunkers
                strategically placed on the fairway to protect players trying to reach the green in two. The key to
                success on this hole is strategy and risk-taking. Players who are confident in their ability to clear
                the bunkers can attempt to reach the green in two, potentially setting themselves up for an eagle or
                birdie. However, those who prefer to play it safe can take a more conservative approach, laying up
                before the bunkers and going for the green in three. The green itself is large and forgiving, but there
                are also bunkers positioned short of the green, which add another layer of difficulty.
